# Calendar Leaderboard

Tool to see who I spend the most time with. Looks for calendar event names with the format '1:1 [person] / [you]'.

Example Output (names redacted):
```
 1: XXXXXX   (60.0 hours)
 2: XXX      (41.2 hours)
 3: XXXXXX   (34.3 hours)
 4: XXXXX    (26.6 hours)
 5: XXXXXX   (23.5 hours)
 6: XXXX     (18.4 hours)
 7: XXXX     (14.7 hours)
 8: XXXXXX   (13.8 hours)
